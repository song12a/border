# Implementation Summary

## Mesh Simplification with MDD and LME

This document provides a technical summary of the mesh simplification implementation based on the concepts from the paper "Out-of-Core Framework for QEM-based Mesh Simplification".

---

## Problem Statement

Implement a mesh simplification algorithm that:
1. Partitions large meshes into smaller sub-meshes (MDD - Minimal Simplification Domain)
2. Simplifies each sub-mesh independently (LME - Local Minimal Edges)
3. Merges simplified sub-meshes back into a single output mesh
4. Preserves geometric details during simplification

---

## Implementation Overview

### Key Components

1. **MeshPartitioner** (`mesh_simplification_mdd_lme.py`)
   - Implements spatial partitioning using octree subdivision
   - Divides the mesh into 8 octants based on spatial position
   - Identifies border vertices (vertices shared between partitions)
   - Extracts sub-meshes with local vertex indexing

2. **LMESimplifier** (`mesh_simplification_mdd_lme.py`)
   - Extends the base QEM simplifier to preserve border vertices
   - Only simplifies interior vertices (non-border)
   - Uses the same QEM algorithm for edge collapse
   - Ensures partition boundaries remain compatible for merging

3. **MeshMerger** (`mesh_simplification_mdd_lme.py`)
   - Merges simplified sub-meshes back together
   - Deduplicates vertices based on:
     - Original vertex indices
     - Position-based matching with tolerance
   - Removes duplicate faces
   - Produces a coherent output mesh

4. **Base QEM Implementation** (`QEM.py`)
   - PLYReader: Handles both ASCII and binary PLY formats
   - PLYWriter: Outputs simplified meshes in ASCII PLY format
   - QEMSimplifier: Core quadric error metric algorithm

## Algorithm Flow

### Step 1: Partitioning (MDD)

```
Input: Mesh (vertices, faces)
Output: List of partitions with border vertex information

1. Calculate mesh bounding box
2. Compute center point
3. Assign each vertex to an octant (0-7) based on position
4. Group faces by partition:
   - Face belongs to partition if all vertices are in that partition
   - Face belongs to multiple partitions if vertices span partitions
5. Mark vertices on partition boundaries as "border vertices"
```

### Step 2: Local Simplification (LME)

```
For each partition:
  1. Extract sub-mesh (vertices, faces) with local indexing
  2. Identify border vertices in local coordinates
  3. Simplify using QEM, but:
     - Skip edges involving border vertices
     - Only collapse interior edges
     - Preserve border vertex positions
  4. Rebuild simplified sub-mesh
```

### Step 3: Merging

```
1. Initialize global vertex map
2. For each simplified sub-mesh:
   - Map local vertices to global indices
   - Deduplicate vertices by:
     a. Original vertex ID (for border vertices)
     b. Position matching (with tolerance)
   - Reindex faces to use global vertex indices
3. Remove duplicate faces
4. Output final mesh
```

## Mathematical Foundation

### Quadric Error Metric (QEM)

For each vertex v, compute quadric matrix Q:
```
Q = Σ Kp
```

where Kp is the quadric for each plane (face) adjacent to v:
```
Kp = [a²   ab   ac   ad]
     [ab   b²   bc   bd]
     [ac   bc   c²   cd]
     [ad   bd   cd   d²]
```

and (a, b, c, d) is the plane equation: ax + by + cz + d = 0

### Edge Collapse Cost

When collapsing edge (v1, v2), the cost is:
```
cost = v̄ᵀ Q v̄
```

where:
- Q = Q₁ + Q₂ (sum of quadrics for both vertices)
- v̄ is the optimal position for the merged vertex

### Optimal Position

Solve for v̄ that minimizes the error:
```
[Q₁₁ Q₁₂ Q₁₃] [x]   [Q₁₄]
[Q₂₁ Q₂₂ Q₂₃] [y] = -[Q₂₄]
[Q₃₁ Q₃₂ Q₃₃] [z]   [Q₃₄]
```

If matrix is singular, use midpoint of edge.

## Key Features

### 1. Border Preservation

Border vertices are preserved to ensure:
- Sub-meshes can be merged without gaps
- Partition boundaries remain compatible
- No cracks in the final mesh

### 2. Vertex Deduplication

The merger uses two strategies:
- **Index-based**: For border vertices with known original indices
- **Position-based**: For vertices within tolerance threshold (1e-6)

This handles cases where:
- Vertices are shared between partitions
- Simplification creates new vertex positions
- Numerical precision differences exist

### 3. Face Deduplication

Faces are deduplicated by:
- Sorting vertex indices
- Using set to track unique face tuples
- Prevents duplicate faces from overlapping partitions

### 4. Flexible Partitioning

The octree approach:
- Creates balanced partitions
- Works for arbitrary mesh sizes
- Can be extended to more partitions (16, 27, etc.)

## Usage Patterns

### Pattern 1: Command-line Processing
```bash
python mesh_simplification_mdd_lme.py
```
Processes all PLY files in input directory.

### Pattern 2: Single File
```python
from mesh_simplification_mdd_lme import process_ply_file

process_ply_file(
    "input.ply",
    "output.ply",
    target_ratio=0.5,
    num_partitions=8
)
```

### Pattern 3: Programmatic
```python
from mesh_simplification_mdd_lme import simplify_mesh_with_partitioning
from QEM import PLYReader, PLYWriter

vertices, faces = PLYReader.read_ply("input.ply")
simplified_v, simplified_f = simplify_mesh_with_partitioning(
    vertices, faces, target_ratio=0.5
)
PLYWriter.write_ply("output.ply", simplified_v, simplified_f)
```

## Performance Characteristics

### Time Complexity

- **Partitioning**: O(V + F) where V = vertices, F = faces
- **Simplification**: O(E log E) per partition where E = edges
- **Merging**: O(V_total) where V_total = sum of simplified vertices

### Space Complexity

- **Partitioning**: O(V + F) for partition data structures
- **Simplification**: O(V + F) per partition (processed independently)
- **Merging**: O(V_total + F_total) for final mesh

### Advantages

1. **Memory efficient**: Processes partitions independently
2. **Parallelizable**: Each partition can be simplified in parallel
3. **Scalable**: Handles large meshes by partitioning
4. **Boundary preservation**: Maintains mesh connectivity

### Limitations

1. **Border vertex overhead**: High ratio of border:interior vertices limits simplification
2. **Small partitions**: Less effective for very small meshes
3. **Octree bias**: Partition quality depends on mesh distribution
